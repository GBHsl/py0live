**NOTE** Pretty sure this doesn't work - leaving this up here to remind me to look at it again... maybe one day. Very experimental, doens't really do much. Read: I was bored one eveneing and attempted to make a bot net. 

py0live (python olive) - A botnet written in python - The name py0live has no significance, i'm just not very good with names.
